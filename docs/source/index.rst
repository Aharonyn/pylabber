Welcome to *pylabber*'s documentation!
======================================

The purpose of *pylabber* is to give researchers the power to manage and share
their data in an open and easy manner. No more hard-drives with valuable data
forgotten in random laboratories' drawers, no more in-house, untested and
unmaintained scripts to inefficiently query your data, stored locally in some
makeshift directory structure. It is meant to give a unified and community-
based solution for all of the vacuous technical work researchers often have
to overcome instead of doing **research**.
